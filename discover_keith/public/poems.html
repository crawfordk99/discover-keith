when will the journey end<br>
screams<br>
the boy <br>
<br>
Each step<br>
walking on a 1000 needles<br>
he questions himself<br>
why <br>
<br>
Suddenly rays of light<br>
touch his eyes <br>
a pillar gateway<br>
comes into view<br>
<br>
The sky pulls apart<br>
the moons become neighbors <br>
a single planet soars<br>
over head<br>
<br>
Clouds lay in his way<br>
a dream<br>
he tells himself <br>
an inscription he finds<br>
<br>
Here lies the gateway to heaven<br>
is carved on the gateways side<br>
The boy breathes in<br>
surveying what lies before him<br>
<br>
He thinks of his bed<br>
the days spent in the mud<br>
the days of laughter<br>
yet this view seems to be calling<br>
<br>
A step forward<br>
the winds seem to be chiming<br>
come closer<br>
Here lies a new dawn<br>

familiar sounds<br>
shadows long forgotten<br>
seem just around the corner<br>
<br>
A hand raises through the sand <br>
the sand crumbles<br>
yet each piece<br>
drags the hand back<br>
<br>
Its silent slither <br>
leaves scars behind <br>
traces of lines<br>
lines scorched in the bark<br>
<br>
Just as it sinks in<br>
a new path <br>
a step into the light<br>
the sand sinks back<br>
<br>
The hand grabs the ledge<br>
pulling up <br>
into a new sea<br>
a sea of change<br>
<br>
This change<br>
brings new leaves <br>
like winter rolling into springs blossoms<br>
Out with the old<br>
<br>
The old chisels<br>
refine <br>
The new chisels<br>
transform<br>
<br>
Rockets blast<br>
leaves blow with the wind<br>
cars zoom by<br>
and steps are formed in the light<br>

to "Hey"<br>
Follow the yellow brick road<br>
Which one?<br>

The grass is always greener<br>
in the mirror<br>
The mirror <br>
points to itself<br>

A circle<br>

brings lines <br>
of black dust<br>

The pen points<br>
to the pothole<br>
The pothole<br>

files flying<br>
lipsticks dropped<br>
shrieks bellow<br>

Under the night sky<br>
shadows creeping<br>
to the nights rhythm <br>
Arms open wide<br>
<br>
Under the night sky<br>
whistles fly<br>
strings are cut<br>
water lines the face<br>
<br>
Under the night sky<br>
light seeps through<br>
the cracks <br>
of the tunnel<br>
<br>
Under the night sky<br>
no compass directing<br>
only footsteps to be heard<br>
and swallowed up<br>

snowflakes fall<br>
blotting out <br>
the night's scars<br>

It can look like <br>
1 more smile<br>
What a domino effect<br>
<br>
Burdens like rocks<br>
are dropped & left behind<br>
with a ripple effect<br>
in life's water<br>
<br>
What once was is<br>
is now was<br>
Like a caterpillar <br>
now a butterfly<br>
<br>
Don't shrink<br>
Change is a drop of joy's juice<br>
The joy <br>
leaves the pain in the rearview<br>
<br>
Change, change, change<br>
What a wonderful word<br>
Forgotten & downtrodden<br>
but always leaves its imprint<br>

Introspective shelf<br>
These rhyming shackles hold me down<br>
Yet help me reach the empty crown<br>

My brains lost in the moonlight<br>
Drifting far away from the sunlight<br>
Inspirations hard to come by<br>
And it's even harder to fly <br>

Slowly the rhythm begins to flow<br>
As I write the ground starts to glow<br>
Good things come in motion<br>
Time to leave the station <br>

I need you <br>
I want to wake up<br>
And see the gardens of heaven in you<br>
<br>
The deep blue sea runs through your eyes<br>
Your voice an angelic melody<br>
All I want is to know you love me<br>
My stress dissapears from your pillow hugs<br>
<br>
Your skin vibrates with the moon light<br>
Oh heavens drums beat with you around<br>
You are all I need<br>
You are all I want<br>
<br>
Mind<br>
I'm sorry for scratching the record<br>
I cannot have you right now<br>
Daylight is up and the dream is dead<br>
<br>
My future is up for grabs<br>
Reality is crueler than evil movies<br>
If I had you <br>
I would forget my responsibilities<br>
<br>
Sacrifice leads to success <br>
If god is willing<br>
This is not the end<br>
But who's patient these days<br>
<br>
Heart and mind <br>
I love you<br>
The day that you are mine <br>
My nightmare will disappear in the wind<br>

Wouldn't bother you <br>
If you would commit to the moment<br>

Knees weak arms are heavy<br>

Your deep blue ocean is waiting for you<br>
These diamonds don't make themselves<br>
<br>
Can't stay stuck in the present <br>
The future will be left in the trash<br>
It's time to dial in to the moment <br>
Nothing gets done by leaving the glass full<br>
<br>
Trash lined up in the alleys<br>
Broken trailer homes <br>
Can't stay stuck in the bottom of the barrel<br>
Got to make a rock-solid plan<br>

Goodbye mom <br>

Is that<br>
There are no rules <br>
Pick any style you want<br>

Whether it's to rhyme <br>
or sweeten it up with imagery lime<br>
any 1 style<br>
or a different style every stanza<br>
<br>
A day in the rain <br>
or your favorite childhood memory<br>

Don't let your friends <br>
tell you poems are out of style<br>
because we all love music<br>
and you can't have music without poems<br>

Dribble to the right <br>
Bend the knees and flick the wrist<br>
And it goes swish <br>

It gave me my first friends <br>
It taught me to play outside <br>
Forgetting about my worries<br>
and just focus on the swish <br>
<br>
Only made 1 team <br>
but for me that doesn't matter <br>
Cause there's always 21 <br>
Shut up the talk with a swish<br>

Watching MJ never gets old<br>
A simple crossover brings so much joy<br>
Kobe with the fade away <br>
Curry with the swish<br>

It brings along the calm wind<br>
The empty restless streets <br>
and a relaxing meeting inside my thoughts<br>
<br>
The seas waves stay flat as far as I see<br>
The storm clouds stay dormant<br>
The music composed of quiet piano solos<br>
Here I am in happiness home <br>
<br>
Volcanoes lose their fire<br>
The animals in hibernation<br>
Stores shut their doors for the night<br>
I look up and I see a picture of the night sky<br>
<br>
Then suddenly the rain drops <br>
Lightning and thunder begin their drums<br>
The music loud and energetic now <br>
Work awaits me <br>
<br>
People are crowding the streets<br>
A volcano erupts<br>
Animals wake to hunt for food<br>
My work keeps me away from silence' cave <br>
<br>
The wind is quite like a racer now <br>
Stores open up their curtains<br>
The light blue sky becomes reality<br>
Thoughts rain into my mind as the day begins<br>

Who could it be she wondered<br>
the knight of her dreams perhaps <br>

A young boy in ragged clothes <br>
His bones seemed a part of his skin<br>

A deep crimson red emitted<br>
The regular green further emphasizing it<br>
They seem to come to life<br>

Leaning up to them close<br>
The wanderer feels the rush of blood<br>
Emotions only red can stir<br>
A pretty face materializes <br>
<br>
Scarlet Scars of love's past are shown <br>
Those unspoken words etched in the rose<br>
The roses stir up into a dance<br>
Their show quite like a raging tornado<br>

In the moonlight the crimson shines<br>
Stories are born from roses <br>
A symbol of the emotion rollercoaster <br>
Its history told by the rose forests <br>

there was all kinds of living beings<br>
small, tall, slithery, strong, and beautiful <br>
The world was quite like heaven <br>
<br>
There was one living being<br>
that stood out from the rest<br>
Tall enough to reach the blue sky<br>
strong enough to carry a city<br>
<br>
There was such a city<br>
the people there having known <br>
the animal since its birth<br>
A city built like a diamond<br>
<br>
The people rustled about through its alleys<br>
meats, fruits, and clothes lined the market<br>
dragons took rest in giant stables<br>
kids causing chaos <br>
<br>
This city while built with cheap stone<br>
gave the feeling of a royal town<br>
The care given by it's people <br>
would be worth diamonds today<br>
<br>
All this was done on the back of one animal<br>
his back as wide as a large lake<br>
the strength of a thousand armies<br>
he took this city all around the world<br>
<br>
Through mountains and volcanoes<br>
through endless dark blue seas<br>
through rain, snow, hurricanes, tornadoes<br>
through winter, spring, summer, and fall <br>
<br>
When the meteor hit<br>
the city that moved <br>
was protected by the being that moved it<br>
Protected like a child<br>
<br>
Now an ancient memory<br>
the city that moved <br>
and the animal that carried it<br>
are buried deep in the ocean<br>
<br>
The story lives on <br>
the people's hearts have left their mark <br>
and the animal's joy carrying them<br>
will never be erased<br>

No sleep to my name <br>
but schools waiting <br>
because that's how the world works<br>
<br>
Every day I'm awake<br>
yet I'm not awake to those around me<br>
I'd rather imagine majestic fantasies<br>
than play the silly game of cold reality<br>
<br>
I want to be social <br>
but all I feel around me is attention lust<br>
even I catch myself sometimes <br>
A world is shaped by it's people<br>
<br>
My friends and my family <br>
They are all I want<br>
money is worth sand to me <br>
but gold to those with power <br>
<br>
I keep on living <br>
searching for the key<br>
to the door of success <br>
Does anyone truly find it<br>
<br>
For each path has its problems<br>
No matter the class<br>
Or skin<br>
Or culture<br>
<br>
Funny how this unsolvable mystery<br>
Drives us all<br>
Despite our flaws <br>
and our mistakes<br>
<br>
It drives us to gain foolish wisdom<br>
to search for fool's gold<br>
for that short smile in triumph<br>
we give it our all<br>
<br>
When I look back <br>
I can only love this world<br>
despite all that I have said<br>
because of the flash of my happiness<br>
<br>
This truly is an insignificant tale <br>
From a diamond still being built<br>
The iron is still being smelt<br>
and the game continues<br>

eyes squinting <br>
mouth wide open<br>
<br>
Tearing down the gift wrap<br>
I find a big, brown box<br>
Is there gold underneath all this wrap?<br>
<br>
I open the covers of the big, brown box <br>
Another slightly smaller, brown box<br>
Forehead lines stress<br>
<br>
Opening the covers again<br>
What a surprise <br>
Another big, brown box<br>
<br>
As my brain gears chug<br>
I open the top <br>
revealing a rainbow colored box <br>
<br>
The tape is like super glue<br>
the rainbow box resists like metal<br>
Scissors, knives fail to cut<br>
<br>
My hands drained<br>
I toss it in the closet<br>
Weeks pass by as my life flashes forward<br>
Before I know it I'm out of school <br>
and looking to fill the hole in my heart<br>
<br>
Yet each date is a brown box<br>
Big, brown, hallow boxes<br>
A sight for the eyes <br>
but poison to the mind<br>
<br>
Finally when all hope is lost<br>
I meet one who glows<br>
Not because of her look<br>
nor because of her brain <br>
but the look in her eyes is a rainbow<br>
<br>
As we talk I find sands of time flow faster<br>
My laugh reaches the sky<br>
My smile beams wider<br>
My confidence turns from bronze to gold<br>
<br>
However, joining our rivers <br>
My words are lost in the dark<br>
I can't crack her code<br>
<br>
Finally, one day as I wake up<br>
I walk to my closet to get my jacket <br>
As I turn on the lights in the closet<br>
I glance at an open rainbow box<br>
<br>
I head over to check it out<br>
my face in a daze at the maze being solved<br>
I look down into the box<br>
There is a picture with words lined up<br>
<br>
The picture is the women I've been seeing<br>
Her smile so sweet and brilliant as an unpolluted night sky<br>
The words read<br>
"Love is a simple thing, but people make it complex" <br>
<br>
Looking back on those words<br>
The big brown boxes came apart like paper<br>
The rainbow box tight like a fortress wall<br>
<br>
My next date <br>
The ring in my pocket<br>
I stepped up to her<br>
with the boxes in mind<br>
my lips moved on their own<br>
My eyes opened with sweat on my forehead<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

My inspiration for it is how the person you love can be anyone and you can find them at any point in your life. You can fuss over what to say to them all you want but in the end it's best to be yourself and keep things simple. You should never put on a show with the one you love. This story poem is a message to myself and my own troubles but if it helps anyone else that reads it I will be happy. </p></div><br /><hr /><br /><div class="p" data-poem-id="13295256" style="page-break-after:always"><h2 class="title" style="margin-bottom: 2px;padding-left:0"><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/13295256-Life--by-Keithacrawford" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none">Life </a></h2>by Keithacrawford on May 10, 2017.&nbsp; &copy;  <div class="body">Oh sweet life <br>

One would think he's tough as nails <br>
The look in his eyes as calm as a nice sunny day<br>
But inside that mind is a balled up child<br>
<br>
A child crying <br>
Slowly bleeding out mentally<br>
The world has told him how to live<br>
He never had a chance<br>
<br>
Unable to admit his fear of the world<br>
He crumbles inside<br>
but he hides his fear<br>
and rides on top of other men<br>
<br>
He looks great to the attention seeking women<br>
He secretly likes the quiet roses<br>
but ends up turning away<br>
because he has to be a man's man <br>
<br>
Work is killing him<br>
He needs a break in a soft and squishy bed <br>
but his kids need the latest tech <br>
A mental disease in the works<br>
<br>
The bars respect him<br>
Pushing him towards another beer<br>
His liver detoriating <br>
He chugs another shot<br>
<br>
His women left him<br>
He cried for a day<br>
The next day he tells his friends he never loved her<br>
A new woman already in the works <br>
<br>
If he were himself <br>
he never would have used drugs<br>
but he's a man <br>

my solar system is born<br>
with it's uniqueness and the best from my real world<br>
I start anew with a head start<br>
<br>
A blue giant beauty much brighter and hotter than the sun is born<br>
9 planets are given life<br>
All similar planets to Earth<br>
every planet is given a people<br>
<br>
Each planet's people is given a chance to build on Earth's advances<br>
Their free will will grant each planet a different history<br>
The one rule being that no one can discriminate nor interfere<br>
between the planets a curiosity heaven for all personalities<br>
<br>
One planet chooses to become one with beautiful rainforests<br>
the next chooses the beach and the blue marine life<br>
another picks a desert life <br>
and one picks the fiery volcanoes <br>
y<br>
<br>
One picks to be diverse much like the Earth <br>
and one picks to focus solely on technology<br>
A devout religious planet is the next<br>
Food becomes the focus of another planet<br>
<br>
Finally the last planet decides on music<br>
With this each planet builds on their uniqueness <br>
Devoid of the politics and simply enjoying their talent<br>
Each planet gives a glow of a beautiful sunset<br>
<br>
These planets know they are not alone<br>
yet they choose to focus on their goal<br>
Rather than being distracted by the flys <br>
they focus on the light in the tunnel<br>
<br>
Something much different than the world of curiosity <br>
Taking all it can into itself<br>
It's greed slowly leaking out it's blood<br>
Until it becomes the world of chaos<br>

yet you were as pretty as a rose<br>
on the inside and outside<br>
I thought why not you<br>

As my trust grew<br>
I began dreaming of our future<br>
Seeing you at the altar <br>
with me holding your hand<br>
<br>
When my love was highest<br>
you announced your move<br>
My heart broke knowing <br>
that I may never see you again<br>

But if you listen to our leaders from youth<br>
It is the only choice<br>
And that is wrong<br>

How can these 3rd grade tricksters trick a nation<br>
Parties go a long way<br>
creating a dividing line<br>

Then when they are in power<br>
We criticize and attack them like a wild lion<br>

we have hit rock bottom<br>

Hot in the sun<br>

How ironic how the desert has done the best job<br>

The forests are cut down<br>

How they can help stop that<br>

jumping at any prey<br>
He is caught in the madness<br>

Give them no response<br>

This sense of hopelessness<br>
Lost people give up<br>

Minimum wage <br>

would not be the only available<br>

A confused life for the middle<br>

The middle wants both<br>

Most blind to the poor <br>
breathing down their necks<br>

Standing in line<br>

What a poor middle<br>
<br>
But the country <br>
has been building this middle <br>
for over 200 years<br>
If only everyone thought like Aristotle<br>
<br>
The separate society of the rich<br>
A culture that most must grow up in<br>
Those that jump from ghetto to rich <br>
Are brought down by gravity<br>
<br>
One is rich <br>
on the backs of generations<br>
If not, then sport and music stars <br>
would never go broke<br>
<br>
The law is different <br>
The air is different<br>
Even the flow of talk is different<br>
<br>
The mountain top is only for them<br>
Race doesn't matter with the rich <br>
There is one culture among them<br>

Made me lose sight of my best friend<br>
<br>
My inspiration has left my soul <br>
I can no longer see <br>
Better left unseen<br>
What else could I write<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Extending from everywhere to a small point<br>
White, hispanic, Mayan, you name it<br>
Sweet Belize has it<br>
<br>
The heat, the lively Sun <br>
Creates a beautiful, lively energy<br>
The beaches outclassing most countries' <br>
Sweet Belize, my paradise<br>
<br>
The language barrier breaks down<br>
Conversation changes from English a espanol to kriol <br>
The blending of culture<br>
Sweet Belize smoothie<br>
<br>
Sweet reggae music<br>
Keeps me calm<br>
Dancehall creates the party<br>
Sweet Belize music<br>
<br>
As I leave<br>
A slight hesistation takes place <br>
The bipolar weather of Chicagoland awaits<br>
Sweet Belize let me stay!<br>

About the money <br>
This country's a liar <br>
This democracy teaches success by inheritance <br>
And imitation is the only way to get an invite<br>
Workers stand no chance<br>
As long as the power positions stay the same color <br>
Hiding behind a different colored leader <br>
Congress yells democracy!<br>
Throw a towel in if your different <br>
The bullies on the playground rule this country<br>
The media shows a strong, beautiful country<br>
All I see is a country of liars<br>
Refusing hope to those at the back of the line<br>
Dependency is different than getting help<br>
But this country's dictionary has clearly defined them the same</div><br /><h4>Author notes</h4><p class="richp">Friend requested this topic</p></div><br /><hr /><br /><div class="p" data-poem-id="12620347" style="page-break-after:always"><h2 class="title" style="margin-bottom: 2px;padding-left:0"><a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/12620347-To-be-or-not-to-be-by-Keithacrawford" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none">To be or not to be</a></h2>by Keithacrawford on April 11, 2016.&nbsp; &copy;  <div class="body">To be or not to be<br>
A cliche line <br>
Yet so wonderfully open ended <br>
I can be something<br>
I can not be something <br>
A contrast of styles <br>
A free agency of choices<br>
Shakespeare the poetic master<br>
His wonderful key to his poems<br>
The mysteries left behind<br>
Leave interpretation 400 years later<br>
In a lightning I will be <br>
And by the thunder I will not be<br>
To inspirations galore I shall go <br>
Leaving one phrase as I exit<br>
To be or not to be<br>

But never painting the final touch<br>
An inspiration that comes from the heart<br>
And is put into words by the mind's summary<br>
A poet does not need a reward <br>
The satisfaction is in writing a clear message yet still a mystery<br>
A non-mystery is not a poem<br>
It is simply an essay with a clear point<br>
The original message is lost in future experiences <br>
But the words are entrenched in history<br>
Always open to interpretation <br>
A worthless poem can become worthwhile<br>
A worthwhile poem can become worthless<br>
For time is just another poem<br>
A clear message yet still a mystery <br>

A constant struggle with reality <br>
A stubbornness to deny ones weaknesses <br>
And show off strengths <br>
Thinking only of how to impress <br>
Rather than removing the guilt that causes stress<br>
A haunting collector of evil thoughts<br>
The endless amount of locks<br>
Hiding the primal wants of a human <br>
The woman's want of a man <br>
And the man's want of a woman<br>
The anger collected over the years <br>
Secretly the mind tears <br>
Wanting something to make the pain go away <br>
Causing one to think the irrational way <br>
Confusing an innocent personality into a killer <br>
The minds an instant thriller<br>
An unsolvable maze <br>
Driving curiosity to discover the secrets of the universe<br>
The mind is the biggest secret in this verse <br>
Driving us away from it <br>
Yet it's the key to understanding every bit <br>
Every little bit of our never-ending madness<br>
Even the reason I'm writing this now <br>
Can not be explained until the mind gives a final bow <br>
To its never-ending contest against our souls <br>
<br>
P.S to whoever reads this I could not fall asleep and got bored and wrote this, so I know it has no poetic structure, I just felt like letting my mind run on about something I've been thinking about since a discussion in English earlier in the day, and I wanted to paint a message with words which is what I feel poetry is. I have no real interest in poetry but sometimes it is fun to let the mind run on and try to paint a message with words.</div></div><br /><hr /><br /></body></html><style>.n { display: none }

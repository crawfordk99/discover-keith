# Overview

I'm going to be building my portfolio site using JavaScript, React, and specfically the Next.js framework. 

I wanted to learn how to use React, and also wanted to build an interactive portfolio. JavaScript and React are perfect for adding interactivity to your website/app. 

If you want multiple pages in your website with react/nextjs, you have to make a separate folder with a page.js for each. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

React used to have a default template option, but it has moved away from that. Now it can either be used in snippets with your JavaScript code, or with a framework like Next.js. I decided on Next.js.

Packages that need to be installed using pnpm add or npm install -. lucide-react, react-icons

# Starting Next.js projects

Run npm run dev, or pnpm dev. You can install pnpm using npm install -g pnpm. Then create a new next.js project using npx create-next-app@latest -projectname-. 

# Comments

Outside of html syntax, just use regular // for JavaScript comments. If you want to make comments inside of html syntax in JavaScript/React components, use {/* */}

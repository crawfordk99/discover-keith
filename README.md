# Overview

I'm going to be building my portfolio site using JavaScript, React, and specfically the Next.js framework. 

I wanted to learn how to use React, and also wanted to build an interactive portfolio. JavaScript and React are perfect for adding interactivity to your website/app. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

React used to have a default template option, but it has moved away from that. Now it can either be used in snippets with your JavaScript code, or with a framework like Next.js. I decided on Next.js.

# Starting Next.js projects

Run npm run dev, or pnpm dev. You can install pnpm using npm install -g pnpm. Then create a new next.js project using npx create-next-app@latest -projectname-.

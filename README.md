# Overview

I'm going to be building my portfolio site using JavaScript, React, and specfically the Next.js framework. 

I wanted to learn how to use React, and also wanted to build an interactive portfolio. JavaScript and React are perfect for adding interactivity to your website/app. I learned basic tailwind CSS as well (allows you to declare html elements with their style, instead of having to create a separate styles file).

# Development Environment

React used to have a default template option, but it has moved away from that. Now it can either be used in snippets with your JavaScript code, or with a framework like Next.js. I decided on Next.js. 

Next.js suggests switching to pnpm as your package manager instead of npm. Pnpm commands like pnpm add, pnpm dev are equivalent to npm install, npm run

Next.js options selected, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (might update to Typescript later)

Packages that need to be installed using pnpm add or npm install -. lucide-react, react-icons

Using Resend's api to handle anyone that would desire to email me through my contact page.
Run pnpm add resend @react-email/components react-email

# Starting Next.js projects

Run npm run dev, or pnpm dev. You can install pnpm using npm install -g pnpm. Then create a new next.js project using npx create-next-app@latest -projectname-. 

# Comments

Outside of html syntax, just use regular // for JavaScript comments. If you want to make comments inside of html syntax in JavaScript/React components, use {/* */}

# Useful notes

If you want multiple pages in your website with react/nextjs, you have to make a separate folder with a page.js for each. 

# Future Work

- Convert to Typescript to add type functionality
- Clean up design, change colors 
- Add more projects
